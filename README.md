# Simple vim config

## Notes

- Currently I'm only using Windows so it's just windows only
- Using lua config from [ nvim-start ](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- I'm too lazy for config stuff now. Just want to code only ðŸ’€

## Commands

### This is fore windows
```shell
 cd ~\AppData\Local\nvim && git clone https://github.com/blurk/vim-config.git .
```
